 EUR_cradle:0 "Cradle of a New Order"
 EUR_cradle_desc:0 "The Eurasian steppes have seen thousands of years of combat, fighting, war,devastation, liberation, freedom, starvation and so on. Born out of this rich historical region, was Eurasianism. An ideology to unite the shattered worldunder one set of beliefs. Our great leader Pyotr Nikolaevich will guide us to thelight of a new world he envisioned. The steppes of Kazakhstan and the Turkic realms is only a stepping stone to what is to come."
 EUR_expedition:0 "An Expedition to Liberate Billions"
 EUR_expedition_desc:0 "Our Eurasian troops are trained with one idea always on their mind - freeing Eurasia. It is their holy duty to liberate billions of unknowing individuals andteach them the way of Eurasianism. It is only a matter of time until the fight toachieve this liberation begins, so we must prepare in every way possible to take on the old order and invite the rise of a great new one."
 EUR_religion:0 "Question of Religion"
 EUR_religion_desc:0 "Our great realm encompasses from the Caspian Sea to the Uigur mountains,and many types of people live under our banner, with many beliefs and religions. The main religion is Sunni Islam, but due to the Siberian Catastrophe, thousands of orthodox Russians, and pagan Yakutsk, that clashes with the Muslims in the streets. The Russian ascendency of our leader has also raised suspicion that he still practises Christianity. Pyotr needs to maintain a delicatebalance between these groups, or else the state and the eurasian dream will collapse."
 EUR_hardships:0 "Economic Hardships of Central Asia"
 EUR_hardships_desc:0 "Although Eurasia is rich in history and people, its not in industry. Most of thetartars focus on nomadic herding, with very few real cities with heavy industry,and due to our tributary system, our economy is very decentralized. CentralAsia is rich in resources though, and if we find a way to extract them, we couldrevert the economic situation. But the Development Plans of our great leader Pyotr have received opposition by the old tartar elites, which could stop the process…"
 EUR_tributary:0 "Tributary System"
 EUR_tributary_desc:0 "One of our great nation’s biggest sources of income is our tributary system. Asour great realm expands, more nations come under our control but instead ofbringing them under direct control, we create tributaries that function like theyused to in times now long passed. Of course, the benefits we get out of thissystem is a burden for those under our control as they are forced to commit alarge part of their resources to us."
