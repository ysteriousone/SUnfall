 SUN_news.1.t:0 "Herbert Kitchener dies"
 SUN_news.1.d:0 " Field Marshal Herbert Kitchener, Lord Protector of the British Empire, has died of natural causes at the age of 78. After surviving the Great War and returning from political obscurity, Kitchener seized control during the series of Crisis, suspending parliamentary rule and declaring a provisional dictatorship to "preserve the Empire." For nearly 15 years, Britain was ruled under his iron grip—orderly, efficient, and cold. With his passing, the power he held so tightly now slips through trembling hands. The House of Lords has convened in emergency session, but rival factions stir in Westminster, in the military, and even among the restless public. The future of Britain hangs in the balance."
